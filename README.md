# Stellar Smart Harvest Bot  

A sophisticated bot that monitors asset prices using the Reflector oracle and automatically executes harvest operations on the Stellar network when price thresholds are met.  

---

## Features  
- **Real-time Price Monitoring**: Uses Reflector network oracle for accurate price data  
- **Automated Harvesting**: Executes smart contract functions when price thresholds are met  
- **Web-based Dashboard**: Easy-to-use interface for monitoring and control  
- **Secure Key Management**: Encrypted private key storage  
- **Configurable Settings**: Flexible configuration for different assets and thresholds  
- **Auto-start Functionality**: Automatically starts when configuration is complete  

---

## Prerequisites  
- **Python 3.8+**  
- **Stellar Testnet account** (automatically created and funded)  
- **Basic understanding of Stellar smart contracts**  

---

## Installation  

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SA-Msweli/harvest.git
cd harvest
```

### Create a virtual environment and install dependencies
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the application
```bash
python app.py
```

Open your browser and navigate to:  
ðŸ‘‰ [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## Configuration  

The bot will automatically create a default configuration file (`config.json`) with the following settings:  

```json
{
  "network": "testnet",
  "horizon_url": "https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org",
  "asset_pair": "KALE/USD",
  "threshold_price": 1.05,
  "kale_contract_id": "CA3D5KRYM6CB7OWQ6TWYRR3Z4T7GNZLKERYNZGGA5SOAOPIFY6YQGAXE",
  "reflector_asset": "KALE",
  "reflector_quote_asset": "USD",
  "schedule_interval": 30,
  "min_balance": 2.0
}
```

You can modify these settings through the web interface or by editing the configuration file directly.  

---

## Usage  

1. **Initial Setup**: The bot automatically creates a Stellar account and funds it using Friendbot (Testnet only).  
2. **Configuration**: Complete the required configuration through the web interface.  
3. **Monitoring**: The bot continuously monitors prices using the Reflector oracle.  
4. **Automated Harvesting**: When the price meets your threshold, the bot executes the harvest function.

## Key Components  
- **Reflector Integration**: Real-time price data from the Reflector network  
- **Smart Contract Interaction**: Direct interaction with KALE smart contracts  
- **Encrypted Storage**: Secure storage of private keys  
- **Web Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring and control interface  
- **Scheduled Operations**: Configurable monitoring intervals  

---

## Security Notes  
- Private keys are encrypted using Fernet symmetric encryption.  
- **Never commit** `secret.key` or `config.json` with sensitive data to version control.  
- The bot is designed for **Testnet use** â€” exercise caution when adapting for Mainnet.  

---

## Troubleshooting  
- **Connection Issues**: Ensure you have a stable internet connection.  
- **Configuration Errors**: Delete `config.json` to reset to default settings.  
- **Port Conflicts**: The app runs on port `5000` by default â€” change if needed.
